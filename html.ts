   *
   * **Note:** ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don't map the 8-bit code points `0x20` to `0x7E` to the `0x0020` to `0x007E` Unicode code points)

   * *   Authors should not use `UTF-32` because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from `UTF-16`.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   *
   * *   The declared character encoding must match the one the page was saved with to avoid garbled characters and security holes.
   * *   The [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element declaring the encoding must be inside the [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head "The HTML <head> element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.") element and **within the first 1024 bytes** of the HTML as some browsers only look at those bytes before choosing an encoding.
   * *   This [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element is only one part of the [algorithm to determine a page's character set](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#encoding-sniffing-algorithm "Algorithm charset page").

   *     **Notes:**
   *
   *     *   Some browsers support the deprecated values of `always`, `default`, and `never` for referrer.

   *
   *     *   Only cooperative robots follow these rules. Do not expect to prevent e-mail harvesters with them.
   *     *   The robot still needs to access the page in order to read these rules. To prevent bandwidth consumption, use a _[robots.txt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/robots.txt "robots.txt: Robots.txt is a file which is usually placed in the root of any website. It decides whether crawlers are permitted or forbidden access to the web site.")_ file.
   *     *   If you want to remove a page, `noindex` will work, but only after the robot visits the page again. Ensure that the `robots.txt` file is not preventing revisits.
   *     *   Some values are mutually exclusive, like `index` and `noindex`, or `follow` and `nofollow`. In these cases the robot's behaviour is undefined and may vary between them.
   *     *   Some crawler robots, like Google, Yahoo and Bing, support the same values for the HTTP header `X-Robots-Tag`; this allows non-HTML documents like images to use these rules.
   *
   * *   `slurp`, is a synonym of `robots`, but only for Slurp - the crawler for Yahoo Search.
   * *   `viewport`, which gives hints about the size of the initial size of the [viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport "viewport: A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window (or the screen, if the document is being viewed in full screen mode).

   * *   `allow-popups`: Allows popups (such as `window.open()`, `target="_blank"`, or `showModalDialog()`). If this keyword is not used, the popup will silently fail to open.
   * *   `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`: Lets the sandboxed document open new windows without those windows inheriting the sandboxing. For example, this can safely sandbox an advertisement without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad links to.
   * *   `allow-presentation`: Lets the resource start a [presentation session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PresentationRequest).
   * *   `allow-same-origin`: If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/same-origin_policy "same-origin policy: The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.").
   * *   `allow-scripts`: Lets the resource run scripts (but not create popup windows).
   * *   `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation` : Lets the resource request access to the parent's storage capabilities with the [Storage Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API).
   * *   `allow-top-navigation`: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context (the one named `_top`).
   * *   `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context, but only if initiated by a user gesture.

   * **Notes about sandboxing:**
   *
   * *   When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is **strongly discouraged** to use both `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`, as that lets the embedded document remove the `sandbox` attribute — making it no more secure than not using the `sandbox` attribute at all.
   * *   Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content outside a sandboxed `iframe` — such as if the viewer opens the frame in a new tab. Such content should be also served from a _separate origin_ to limit potential damage.
   * *   The `sandbox` attribute is unsupported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier.

HTML5 specification urges authors to omit the attribute rather than provide a redundant MIME type. In earlier browsers, this identified the scripting language of the embedded or imported (via the `src` attribute) code. JavaScript MIME types are [listed in the specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#JavaScript_types).
   * *   **`module`:** For HTML5-compliant browsers the code is treated as a JavaScript module. The processing of the script contents is not affected by the `charset` and `defer` attributes. For information on using `module`, see [ES6 in Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/). Code may behave differently when the `module` keyword is used.
   * *   **Any other value:** The embedded content is treated as a data block which won't be processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. The `src` attribute will be ignored.
   *
   * **Note:** in Firefox you could specify the version of JavaScript contained in a `<script>` element by including a non-standard `version` parameter inside the `type` attribute — for example `type="text/javascript;version=1.8"`. This has been removed in Firefox 59 (see [bug 1428745](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428745 "FIXED: Remove support for version parameter from script loader")).
