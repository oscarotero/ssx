   * **Note:** ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don't map the 8-bit code points `0x20` to `0x7E` to the `0x0020` to `0x007E` Unicode code points)
   *
   * *   Authors **must not** use `CESU-8`, `UTF-7`, `BOCU-1` and/or `SCSU` as [cross-site scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks with these encodings have been demonstrated.
   * *   Authors should not use `UTF-32` because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from `UTF-16`.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   *
   * *   The declared character encoding must match the one the page was saved with to avoid garbled characters and security holes.
   * *   The [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element declaring the encoding must be inside the [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head "The HTML <head> element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.") element and **within the first 1024 bytes** of the HTML as some browsers only look at those bytes before choosing an encoding.
   * *   This [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element is only one part of the [algorithm to determine a page's character set](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#encoding-sniffing-algorithm "Algorithm charset page"). The [`Content-Type` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) and any [Byte-Order Marks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Byte-Order_Mark "The definition of that term (Byte-Order Marks) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!") override this element.
   * *   It is strongly recommended to define the character encoding. If a page's encoding is undefined, cross-scripting techniques are possible, such as the [`UTF-7` fallback cross-scripting technique](https://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7).
   * *   The [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element with a `charset` attribute is a synonym for the pre-HTML5 `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=_IANAcharset_">`, where _`IANAcharset`_ contains the value of the equivalent [`charset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-charset) attribute. This syntax is still allowed, although no longer recommended.

   *     **Notes:**
   *
   *     *   Some browsers support the deprecated values of `always`, `default`, and `never` for referrer.
   *     *   Dynamically inserting `<meta name="referrer">` (with [`document.write`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write) or [`appendChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)) makes the referrer behaviour unpredictable.

   *     **Notes:**
   *
   *     *   Only cooperative robots follow these rules. Do not expect to prevent e-mail harvesters with them.
   *     *   The robot still needs to access the page in order to read these rules. To prevent bandwidth consumption, use a _[robots.txt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/robots.txt "robots.txt: Robots.txt is a file which is usually placed in the root of any website. It decides whether crawlers are permitted or forbidden access to the web site.")_ file.
   *     *   If you want to remove a page, `noindex` will work, but only after the robot visits the page again. Ensure that the `robots.txt` file is not preventing revisits.
   *     *   Some values are mutually exclusive, like `index` and `noindex`, or `follow` and `nofollow`. In these cases the robot's behaviour is undefined and may vary between them.
   *     *   Some crawler robots, like Google, Yahoo and Bing, support the same values for the HTTP header `X-Robots-Tag`; this allows non-HTML documents like images to use these rules.
   *
   * *   `slurp`, is a synonym of `robots`, but only for Slurp - the crawler for Yahoo Search.
   * *   `viewport`, which gives hints about the size of the initial size of the [viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport "viewport: A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window (or the screen, if the document is being viewed in full screen mode). Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view."). Used by mobile devices only.

   *
   *     Defines the height of the viewport. Not used by any browser.
   *
   *     `initial-scale`
   *
   *     A positive number between `0.0` and `10.0`

   *
   *     `maximum-scale`
   *
   *     A positive number between `0.0` and `10.0`
   *
   *     Defines the maximum amount to zoom in. It must be greater or equal to the `minimum-scale` or the behaviour is undefined. Browser settings can ignore this rule and iOS10+ ignores it by default.
   *
   *     `minimum-scale`
   *
   *     A positive number between `0.0` and `10.0`

   *
   *     `yes` or `no`

   * *   `allow-pointer-lock`: Lets the resource use the [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Pointer_Lock).
   * *   `allow-popups`: Allows popups (such as `window.open()`, `target="_blank"`, or `showModalDialog()`). If this keyword is not used, the popup will silently fail to open.
   * *   `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`: Lets the sandboxed document open new windows without those windows inheriting the sandboxing. For example, this can safely sandbox an advertisement without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad links to.
   * *   `allow-presentation`: Lets the resource start a [presentation session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PresentationRequest).
   * *   `allow-same-origin`: If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/same-origin_policy "same-origin policy: The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.").
   * *   `allow-scripts`: Lets the resource run scripts (but not create popup windows).
   * *   `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation` : Lets the resource request access to the parent's storage capabilities with the [Storage Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API).
   * *   `allow-top-navigation`: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context (the one named `_top`).
   * *   `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context, but only if initiated by a user gesture.
   *
   * **Notes about sandboxing:**
   *
   * *   When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is **strongly discouraged** to use both `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`, as that lets the embedded document remove the `sandbox` attribute — making it no more secure than not using the `sandbox` attribute at all.
   * *   Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content outside a sandboxed `iframe` — such as if the viewer opens the frame in a new tab. Such content should be also served from a _separate origin_ to limit potential damage.
   * *   The `sandbox` attribute is unsupported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier.
